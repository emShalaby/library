# Library

## This project was part of The Odin Project curriculum.<br></br>

### A simple library that contains your book list.<br></br>

At first i did this project with messy code , but then i came back to it after
learning about factory functions and module pattern and redid the whole code.<br></br>

that process took me a day which is less than expected but this will be the last time i come back to it and now will move on to other projects<br></br>
